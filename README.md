## App Brainstorming 

My Favorite Applications:  
Depop
Spotify 
Pinterest 


Features of the Applications:  

1. User Interaction/ Community Engagement:
All three applications foster user interaction and community engagement. Depop and Spotify have social elements, enabling users to connect, share, and engage with each other. Pinterest, with its collaborative boards and social sharing, also promotes a sense of community. 

2. Personalization and Recommendations:
Personalization is a key aspect across the board. Spotify, Depop, and Pinterest employ algorithms to offer personalized experiences. Spotify recommends music based on user preferences, Depop suggests items tailored to individual tastes, and Pinterest delivers personalized content recommendations.
3. Search and Discovery:
Robust search and discovery features are present in all three apps. Users can easily find what they're looking for or discover new content. Whether it's finding unique secondhand items on Depop, exploring new music on Spotify, or discovering inspirational content on Pinterest, search and discovery are fundamental.

4. Visual Content Focus:
Visual content plays a significant role in Depop, Spotify (album covers, playlists), and Pinterest. Each app emphasizes the importance of visuals, whether it's showcasing fashion items on Depop, album artwork on Spotify, or visually organizing ideas on Pinterest boards.



## An App I'd Like to Build:  
I aspire to develop an educational financial literacy app tailored for individuals aged 14-25, focusing on imparting essential knowledge about investing. My motivation stems from personal experiences, realizing the lack of financial education within our current American school system, unless one pursues a finance-related major. Basic concepts such as opening a credit card, understanding the significance of a credit score, or the fundamentals of a Roth IRA are often overlooked.

I firmly believe that financial literacy is a critical component of common knowledge, and unfortunately, many individuals, particularly those in underprivileged communities, lack access to this information. My goal is to bridge this gap through an application that is not only free but also accessible to everyone, fostering an inclusive environment.

In our society, characterized by capitalism and individualism, there is a pressing need for applications that bring people together for mutual betterment. I envision an app that serves as a valuable resource for financial education, empowering users with the knowledge and skills necessary for making informed financial decisions.

The features I aim to implement include engaging lectures, insightful quizzes, and video tutorials demonstrating practical steps, such as how to open a brokerage account. These seemingly simple yet crucial aspects of financial management are often absent from mainstream education, and I aim to fill this void by providing a platform that equips users with the tools they need to navigate the complex world of finance successfully.
